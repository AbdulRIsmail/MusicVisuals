# Description of the assignment
A beautiful program that visualises multiple shapes all beautifully and elegantly synchronized into one output. It syncs with the music and "dances" with it. Best part is... you can control the entire program with a GUI... yes everything!

# Instructions
Simply compile the program and run it! The GUI and the program will both start. 

# How it works
When the program is first ran, all the shapes load together, from there on using the control panel I made (GUI) you customize everything from hiding/displaying some shapes and changing the colour with ease.

You have a general settings that controls all the shapes, You can:
- Hide / Show all
- Color (change everything at once)
- Go back 10s or skip 10s
- Pause / Play
- Music tracker (you can see a music player, like YouTube)

You then have separate shapes you can control, when you control these, they're individual and does not affect others
One of the shapes you can control the speed, *I show it in the demo video*

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am most proud of the creating a control panel (GUI). So much research went into this and I think this is what completes the program, having a GUI simply makes the program more elegant, the fact you're able to see all the available options and have full control is sweet! 

Also adding the music track in the GUI, let's you know how far into the music you are, I thought this was a pretty sweet finish touch.
